Search Engine Project in C++ is an academic search engine application designed to search relevant academic information and records in schools, colleges and universities. It supports two popular search engines: Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search. With this application, students in colleges and universities can search academic information based on the keywords and titles provided for search.

The coding of this project is done in C++ language using QT design tool in Linux platform. You can download the complete source code and project files of Search Engine C++ project from the download links in this post. The project report and documentation is not available at the moment, so below is a brief introduction of project to help you understand the features and modes of this Search Engine
**About Search Engine Project in C++:**
Most academic institutions, colleges and universities, have their own websites that provide information regarding studentsâ€™ research papers, project source codes and project reports. These records can be used as a reference by new students entering the colleges and universities. This search engine provides a platform to find out such records, information and data that can help students in the academic works.

This C++ Search Engine Project supports two basic search engines: Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Scholar. Compared to Microsoft Academic Search, the search base of Google Scholar is large. Also, the project includes combined engine: Google Scholar cum Microsoft Academic Scholar along with two fake search engines: Single Test Search and Combined Double Test Search.

The list of search engines in this project are outlined below. The last two engines simply response with random search results waiting random time.

Search Modes:

Also, this Search Engine project in C++ features three different search modes. These are listed below; the mode of search is detected automatically by the system and is dependent on request.

Single Person + Single Search Engine
Single Person + Multiple Search Engines
Multiple Users + Multiple Search Engines
For each of these modes, the program generates one thread. So, when the last mode is used, i.e. when multiple users use the search engine application, the program generates one thread for every user. Also, the program maintains one minute search timeout for each task.

In case of Single Person + Single Search Engine mode, graph of articles is generated with approximation. Multiple names can be searched by using new line separated option. For each search query, count of articles can be displayed. The displayed search results can be saved using save option in JSON format.
